## Inspiration
One of our friend is a bit bad in algebra so we decide to make a tool to help him surpase his difficulty in math.
## What it does
You enter an algebric equation with 1 unknow and you let the magic of our code work.
You should get a good answer.
## How we built it
We used the programing language python and the library FastAPI to make the backend and get the user input and pass it to the parser.
## Challenges we ran into
I think making a effective parser and the to simplifie the equation to solve it.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I think making the hacktton and building from scratch our project his one of our biggest accomplishments.
## What we learned
We learned how to work with FastAPI and to algebra calculation in python
## What's next for The Algebric Calculator
I think we will try to implement with 2 or even 3 unknow.
